# Book Condenser: Ultra-Dense Full-Spectrum Book Recreation

Recreate any book in ~25% of its original size — a dense, structured reconstruction that preserves every important idea, framework, argument, story, and insight.

## What It Does

This skill transforms your AI agent into an expert book analyst that produces a single, self-contained reference document covering the ENTIRE spectrum of a book. Unlike shallow summaries, this creates a dense reconstruction where someone who reads only the condensed version can discuss any part of the book intelligently.

- **Full coverage** -- every chapter, every section, every major and minor idea represented
- **Framework preservation** -- all models, matrices, lists, and structured thinking tools reproduced in full
- **Story compression** -- key examples and case studies condensed but never deleted
- **Quote preservation** -- iconic and quotable lines kept verbatim
- **Author's structure** -- original chapter/section organization maintained

## How It Works

1. **Setup** -- confirms the book, gathers density preferences (15-35% of original), output format (structured/prose/hybrid), and any focus areas
2. **Blueprint** -- produces a structural map with chapter summaries, key frameworks, stories, and quotes before writing
3. **Writing** -- reconstructs each chapter with dense prose, preserved frameworks, compressed examples, and key quotes
4. **Delivery** -- saves as markdown with appendices (master framework reference, quotes collection, action items)

## Density Levels

| Level | Size | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| Maximum | ~15-20% | Books you've read; want a quick reference |
| Balanced | ~25% | Most use cases (recommended) |
| Readable | ~30-35% | First exposure to the book |

## Output Formats

- **Structured Reference** -- headers, bullets, boxed quotes, tables (recommended)
- **Flowing Prose** -- reads like a compressed version of the book
- **Hybrid** -- prose for narratives, structured for frameworks

## Usage

```
/book-condenser Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman
/book-condenser The Pragmatic Programmer by Hunt and Thomas
/book-condenser Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
```

## Triggers

- "condense this book"
- "summarize the book"
- "recreate the book"
- "compress the book"
- "dense version of"
- "book summary"
- "distill the book"
- "book in 25%"

## Edge Cases Handled

- **Books not in training data** -- offers to work from provided content or web research
- **Very long books (500+ pages)** -- parallelizes via sub-agents for speed
- **Fiction** -- adapts to preserve dialogue, character arcs, prose style, and themes
- **Technical/textbooks** -- preserves formulas, algorithms, code snippets, and definitions exactly
